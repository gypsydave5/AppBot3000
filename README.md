AppBot 3000
==========

AppBot 3000 is my application to the scholarship opportunity to Makers Academy being offered (very generously) by Skimlinks. AppBot3000.rb is written in Ruby, runs entirely in the console, features advanced gameplay and graphics from 1979 and even an easter egg or two (well it is meant to be spring...).

It was shamelessly adapted from a game by my friend Josh Hill (https://github.com/jamesjoshuahill/joshs_makers_game), which he wrote in answer to exercise 36 of Ruby the Hard Way (http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex36.html)

The colours were taken from Ivan Black in this StackOverflow thread: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1489183/colorized-ruby-output

It's also the first ever thing I've put on GitHub :)
