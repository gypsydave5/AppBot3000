AppBot 3000
==========

AppBot 3000 is my application to the scholarship opportunity to Makers Academy being offered (very generously) by Skimlinks. AppBot3000.rb is written in Ruby, runs entirely in the console, features advanced gameplay, graphics and AI from 1979 and even an easter egg or two (well it is meant to be spring...). It talks a bit about me and my life, and how a scholarship to MA would make such an amazing difference to me.

It was shamelessly adapted from a game by my friend Josh Hill (https://github.com/jamesjoshuahill/joshs_makers_game), which he wrote in answer to exercise 36 of Ruby the Hard Way (http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex36.html)

The colours were taken from Ivan Black at StackOverflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1489183/colorized-ruby-output), and please me by 'duck punching'/'monkey patching' (what a phrase!) the String class.

It's also the first ever thing I've put on GitHub :)
