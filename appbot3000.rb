Hi, I'm AppBot 3000, and I've been sent on a special mission from

weeks would change David Wickes' life. Dave's my creator - he made me!

So ask me some questions. Questions like:

  puts %{
David Wickes is a 34 year old human male, originally
from Wisbech, a town in the Fens of East Anglia. He moved
to London in 2010 to see the big city where he met
his partner, Stephanie, with whom he lives in Wandsworth
with Erik the dog.

He studied philosophy at Warwick University for seven
long years before that, becoming highly educated in a
very abstract way. In his time he has been a warden,
a proofreader, a mobile librarian, a private tutor,
a copywriter and a digital marketeer.

He's had jobs - but he's never really had a career.

def what
  puts "AppBot 3000 displaying current work...".green
  puts %{
At the moment Dave works in digital marketing. He enjoys
a lot of what this involves - creative copy writing, analysis
of website data, coming up with creative solutions, knowing
how to implement best practices for a website design - but lately
he's been feeling like he could do more, and that that more
isn't going to be more marketing... he needs more of a 
technical yet creative challenge in his life, - 
he feels more like an engineer, a problem solver, a hero
working on the bleeding edge of technology. He doesn't
just want to be recommending the the best new apps to his
friends and colleagues - he wants to write them! Or at least
an API for them...

In short, he wants to be a software developer.

end

def history
  puts "AppBot 3000 searching database... well, not really a database... anyway...".green

  puts %{
Let's look at Dave's long relationship with coding:

1987 -  ZX Spectrum. Dave carefully copies programs out of books
	   to play games. And not very good games either.
	   
1992 -  286 PC. The games get better, but more importantly Dave
	learns his way around the DOS shell.

1996 -  Acorn Archimedes. No programming goes on in the GCSE in IT
	- none at all. Dave becomes disenchanted and does more science.

2003 -  Turing Machines. Taking Advanced Symbolic Logic at
	university exposes Dave to writing instructions for
	Turing machines and	peculiar logical languages.
	He never quite manages to understand Goedels theorems.

2009 - 	HTML/CSS. A lifelong interest in typography and design is
	given an outlet when the boss asks Dave to "make the
	website look better."

2010 -	JavaScript. Someone at work says "Hey, can we make a
	drop-down menu that updates with the next two months
	weekdays not including bank holidays?". "Sure," says
	Dave, and spends the next week working out how to
	hack the company CMS to accept a short piece of code.

2012 -	PHP/SQL. The boss says he's got no idea how the database
	works, and that the developers won't tell him. Dave
	gets a book, hacks through the pages of PHP that make
	up the website, and reverse engineers the SQL database
	structure. Then he works out how to improve it.
}
  your_move(standard_moves)
end

def why
  puts %{
Dave has been working on the edges of coding for most of his life.
A 'responsive dabbler' he learns as much as he needs to fix the
problem in front of him and no more, whether that means editing
an AUTOEXEC.BAT file to free up system memory, or finding out how
to make a marketing email responsive. He really enjoys solving
these problems - even ones he sets himself - and he's successful.

Most of the time.

The problem is that this approach only gets him so far. Without
knowledge of development practices, how all the bits in the stack
fit together, how memory works and is accessed, how to refactor
properly -  he'll always get tangled up in horrible, spaghetti
code, banging his head against the Internet.

He's spoken to friends in the industry, talking about what they
do and the experience of coding full time. He's gone through
the exercises at codecademy.com (www.codecademy.com/gypsydave5)
He's read books and practiced at home. He's never done anything 
that has made him feel as fulfilled as coding. He is ready now.
Dave's New Year's Resolution is to learn to code properly
- PROPERLY - from the ground up, and to change his career to
development. However long it takes, he knows he can do it.

end

def how

  puts %{

So, the big question - how would this change Dave's life?

1.	Instead of learning sloooowly, in his spare time, while
	doing a job he no longer enjoys, he would be given a
	turbo-charged boost to a new career.
	
2.	Instead of learning on his own in front of a monitor,
	watching videos and completing tasks on the internet,
	he'd be in a room with motivated people like him - all
	egging each other on and swapping advice and inspiration.
	
3.	Instead of spending the next year hunting around for the
	answers to his questions on coding on the internet he'll
	be able to get the answers from leading software engineers
	directly. Right from the source.
	
4.	Instead of more of his unfulfilling work in marketing, Dave
	would get into a job he enjoys much sooner. Fitter, happier,
	more productive, Dave will be happier, Steph will be happier,
	Erik the dog will be happier too (he's already pretty happy).

he's writing code at his computer. MA will give him the opportunity
to have a career he loves rather than just a job.

3000 wouldn't be such a clunky piece of software running in the

this application. Do it for the future -
